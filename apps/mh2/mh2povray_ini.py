Abstract
--------

This module allows POV-Ray export parameters to be configured. 
These parameters can be changed while the MakeHuman application is running without having
to reload the application.

# The output path defines the standard output directory and the generated include file name.
# The default directory is pov_output, within the MakeHuman installation directory.
# The default include file name is makehuman.inc.

# The export routine can generate a simple mesh2 object that is quick to render, but
# quite inflexible, or it can generate an array based format along with various macros
# that can be used in a wide variety of ways, but which is slower to render.

format = 'mesh2'  # "array" or "mesh2"

# The POV-Ray export function can just export the object or it can also call POV-Ray to
# render a scene file. By default the scene file will be the generated sample scene file.

# By default the "render" action renders the generated POV scene file, but you can
# specify a scene file to render instead.
